Then using this knowledge it can apply control outputs that best fits the desired behaviour of said system. For each applied control output, it reasses the future predicted states and corrects the applied control output, this makes it more adaptable to dynamic environments in comparison to LQR. The accurarcy and sensitivity of an MPC can be tuned based on the importance for mainting desired state or control effort."
